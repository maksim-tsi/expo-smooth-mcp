# Exponential Smoothing Forecasting via Model Context Protocol (MCP)

This repository contains the implementation for our research on provisioning established statistical methods to Large Language Model (LLM) agents. It features a Gradio web application that provides an interactive demonstration of Exponential Smoothing for time-series forecasting, using a real-world Supply Chain Management (SCM) dataset.

## Research Context and Motivation

This project serves as a proof-of-concept for research aimed at enhancing LLM-based assistants with robust, traditional statistical capabilities. While LLMs excel at reasoning and language, they are not inherently reliable for precise mathematical forecasting.

Our central hypothesis is that by encapsulating trusted statistical models (like Exponential Smoothing) as tools and serving them via the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, we can create AI agents that are both conversational and quantitatively sound. This approach allows an LLM to "call" the statistical tool when a user asks for a forecast, grounding its response in a proven algorithm.

## System Architecture

The system is designed with a clear separation of concerns, enabling the LLM to leverage a specialized forecasting tool:

                                                 +--------+--------+
                                                          |

## Getting Started (Local Development)

To set up and run this project on your local machine, please follow the instructions below.

### For External Contributors (Recommended Method)

If you are contributing for the first time or prefer using standard Python virtual environments, this is the recommended approach.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/maksim-tsi/expo-smooth-mcp.git
    cd expo-smooth-mcp
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
    We recommend using `venv`, which is included with Python.
    ```bash
    # Create the environment
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate the environment
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Install all required packages using `pip`.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run the Gradio Application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    Access the application in your browser at the local URL provided (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:7860/`).
